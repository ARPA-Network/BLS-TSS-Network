# How To Reactivate Once the Node Slashed/Quitted

## General Guidance

Assuming everything is working properly, all you need to do is to call the contract.

Which means, you are going to need 
- [NodeRegistry Contract](https://github.com/ARPA-Network/BLS-TSS-Network/blob/0732850fe39f869a7dea899e445dfe6332462ab7/contracts/src/interfaces/INodeRegistry.sol)
- The address of the contract: listed in our [Official Document](https://docs.arpanetwork.io/randcast/supported-networks-and-parameters), then
- Call nodeActivate method (if still doesn't work, contact us via telagram group)
